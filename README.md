# SESMB-based Infrastructure in Python

Each subproject has its own README file and documentation. Please start for SES-based modeling with the tool SESToPy. The documentation for this software also contains a description of the infrastructure. Instructions on how to use the infrastructure are stored in the README file and the documentation for the SESEcPy tool.
